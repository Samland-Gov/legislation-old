# Explanatory Memorandum on Road Traffic Convention

Explanatory Memorandum on the Convention on Road Traffic
Title of Treaty: Convention on Road Traffic
Command Paper Number: 1

## Subject Matter

**1** This Explanatory Memorandum refers to the proposed ratification by Samland to the
Convention on Road Traffic done at Vienna on 8 November 1968 ("the 1968 Convention")
including the amendments to the 1968 Convention.

**2** The 1968 Convention builds on the Convention on Road Traffic made at Geneva on 19 September 1949 ("the 1949 Convention"), and replaces the 1949 Convention between parties to both Conventions. The 1968 Convention contains provisions on the rules of the road, the conditions for the admission of motor vehicles and trailers to international traffic, the drivers of motor vehicles in international traffic, and conditions for the admission of cycles and mopeds to international traffic.

**3** The Samland President has decided on 12 August 2023 to ratify the 1968 and 1949 Conventions for reasons of uniformity, to increase safety and to facilitate international traffic and improve relations with Contracting parties of the Conventions.

## Policy Considerations

### General

**4** Samland currently conforms to the overwhelming majority of provisions of the 1968 Vienna
Convention, with several parts covered under road (under construction) traffic legislation, including the Road Traffic Act, the Road Traffic Offenders Act, the Road Traffic Regulation Act, the Traffic
Management Act, the Highway Act, the Motor Vehicle (International Circulation) Act and secondary legislation made under those Acts, as well as being communicated to motorists through the Highway Code.

### Highway Code

**5** The Highway Code is made under powers set out in the Road Traffic Act and as such, has
similar status to statutory guidance. While many of the Code's rules are mandatory, others are advisory. Failure to comply with advisory rules may be used in evidence in court proceedings to
establish liability. Samland also has respected standards for driving theory and practical tests as well as stringent requirements on the development, and use of the MOT system of vehicle testing.

**6** This Convention includes rules for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians and other road users, including requirements to comply with traffic signs, the parking and manoeuvring of vehicles and
behavioural expectations of road users.

### Trailer Registration

**7** While the Convention does not require contracting parties to register trailers, unregistered trailers may be turned away by other contracting parties, or enforcement action taken against them. As
such, the government will be introducing a trailer registration scheme to ensure access for UK
trailers to other territories which will address outstanding issues faced by the freight industry in a
number of EU Member States. It is proposed that registration will be mandatory for all commercial
trailers, and the largest non-commercial trailers, that enter international traffic. Voluntary
registration will be available for other types of trailer, which includes common trailers, such as
caravans or horse boxes.

### International Driving Permits

**8** The Government also intends to amend the Motor Vehicles (International Circulation) Order 1975
to ensure that 1968 Convention International Driving Permits ("IDPs") can be issued to drivers
based in Samland and to ensure the recognition of 1968 Convention IDPs presented by drivers based
outside Samland.

### Earlier Conventions

**9** Once ratified, the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic Convention will replace earlier
Conventions, principally the 1949 Convention, in relation to contracting parties to the 1968
Convention who are also party to the earlier Convention. The 1949 Convention will continue to
apply between Samland and states that are contracting parties to the 1949 Convention but not the
1968 Convention, for example Australia, Japan, the Republic of Ireland and Spain.

### The Use of Automated Vehicle Technology

**10** The ongoing development of this technology has the potential to radically improve road safety by reducing human error and will bring the benefits of personal mobility to those who cannot currently drive motor vehicles. Vehicles with these technologies would be able to carry out all the operational functions (for example, steering, acceleration, and braking) and all the tactical functions (for example, rule-based decisions, such as overtaking, the negotiation of a junction, the selection of a suitable headway, or the decision to go ahead or yield to another road user) needed to operate the vehicle on the road.

**11** Samland, like many other contracting parties to the Conventions, considers that the testing and use of automated vehicles is not prohibited by either the 1949 Convention or the 1968 Convention. This applies to all automated vehicles, including those where the person driving only decides whether or not to use the automated vehicle, schedules the trip/journey, and chooses waypoints and destinations.

**12** The ratification of the 1968 Convention and any changes that are being made will not make any difference on the Government's ambition to keep Samland at the very forefront of developing, testing, and enabling the use of automated vehicles. Indeed, ratification affords Samland an opportunity to better shape the evolution and future direction of both Conventions and the ancillary documents which relate to them, including for automated vehicles.

**13** Samland notes that the Global Forum for Road Traffic Safety, the United Nations body responsible for the Conventions, is currently developing an ancillary document with recommendations to help states that are party to one or both Convention to address the integration of automated vehicles in road traffic. Furthermore, Samland notes that the Forum has agreed that requirements that "o driver... shall... minimise any activity other than driving" in Article 8(6), should be interpreted with the following principles in mind, and that amendments to either Convention were not needed in this regard.

**14** In the case of non-driving activities, the Forum has agreed that:

- a. When the vehicle is driven by vehicle systems that do not require the driver to perform
the driving task, the driver can engage in activities other than driving as long as:
  - i. these activities do not prevent the driver from responding to demands from the
  vehicle systems for taking over the driving task, and
  - ii. these activities are consistent with the prescribed use of the vehicle systems and
  their defined functions

**15** Article 8(6) also requires "legislation shall prohibit[s] the use by a driver of a motor vehicle or moped of a hand-held phone while the vehicle is in motion". The Forum has agreed that RemoteControl Parking does not compromise road safety in parking manoeuvres, including when a hand held phone is used as the remote-control device.

### Financial

**16** The additional cost of implementing new systems following ratification is anticipated to be
minimal as Samland already intends to conform to almost all the requirements of the Convention.

**17** There will however, be some costs in relation to the provision of a new system for issuing 1968
Convention compliant IDPs, and the provision of a registration system for trailers travelling
overseas, which is being introduced by the (under construction) Haulage Permits and Trailers Bill. This is planned to be introduced in Congress at the same time as the Command Paper associated with this Explanatory Memorandum.

### Declarations

#### Highway Code

**18** Samland intends to declare that it is compliant with many of the Rules in the Convention through the Highway Code (road safety and vehicle rules) including those which are advisory in nature. Section 38(7) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 states that any failure to observe a provision of the Code can be relied upon in proceedings by any party looking to establish civil or criminal liability. The process for amending or making a new rule is set out in legislation and is similar for the making of a negative procedure statutory instrument.

#### Distinguishing sign

**19** In accordance with Article 45(4), Samland intends to declare that the distinguishing sign it has selected for display in international traffic on vehicles registered by it is "ZL" and that the distinguishing sign that it will use on vehicle registration certificates issued by it, as required by Article 35(l)(c)(i), is "ZL".

#### Mopeds

**20** In accordance with Article 54(2), Samland intends to declare that, for the purposes of the application of the 1968 Convention, it treats mopeds as motorcycles. Electrically Assisted Powered Cycles (EAPC) as pedal cycles

**21** Samland intends to declare that, for the purposes of the application of the 1968 Convention, Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycles ("EAPC") meeting the criteria set out in regulations are treated as cycles.

#### Territorial Extent of this Convention

**22** Samland intends to declare that, for the purposes of the application of the 1968 Convention, the effect of Article 48 is limited to the whole territory of the Samland.

### Reservations

**23** In accordance with Article 54(5), Samland intends to enter reservations against the following
provisions of the 1968 Convention:

- Article 20(6)(b) (pedestrians crossing the highway)
- Article 23(2)(a) (parking direction) [1]
- Article 25 bis (2) (special regulations for tunnels indicated by special road signs)
- Article 32(6), (8), (9) and (10) (display of lamps by motorbikes during the day and use of parking lamps at night)

(1) We are specifically reserving against the second sentence which states "A driver shall not stand or park his
vehicle on a carriageway save on the side appropriate,for him to the direction of traffic;"

#### Securing and marking of loads (Article 30(4))

**24** In relation to Article 30(4) Samland intends to make a partial reservation against this provision. Samland allows several exceptions to the rules contained in this section including for straddle carriers and agricultural vehicles.

#### Drivers of passenger or goods vehicles temporarily in Samland (Article 41)

**25** In relation to Article 41, Samland intends to reserve the right not to permit a person to drive a vehicle, other than one brought into and only temporarily in Samland, if (i) the vehicle is used for the carriage of persons for hire or reward or for the carriage of goods and (ii) the driver of such a vehicle would, by the domestic legislation of Samland, be required to have a special vocational licence.

### Implementation of the provisions in the Convention

**26** Samland implements the provisions of this Convention through our (under construction) domestic legislation and regulations. These include the Road Traffic Act, the Road Traffic Offenders Act, the Road Traffic Regulation Act, the Traffic Management Act, the Highway Act, the Motor Vehicle (International Circulation) Act and secondary legislation made under those Acts. We also demonstrate conformity through The Highway Code which is applicable in. We are specifically reserving against the second sentence which states "A driver shall not stand or park his vehicle on a carriageway save on the side appropriate,for him to the direction of traffic;"
