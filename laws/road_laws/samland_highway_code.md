## Article 6: Traffic Signals

Traffic signals are used to control the flow of traffic at intersections. They consist of three main phases: red, yellow (amber), and green.

1. **Red Light Phase:** When the traffic signal displays a red light, drivers must come to a complete stop behind the designated stop line or before the intersection. It indicates that traffic from other directions has the right of way. Proceeding through a red light is strictly prohibited.

2. **Yellow (Amber) Light Phase:** The yellow (amber) light follows the red light phase. It serves as a warning that the signal is about to change to red. Drivers should prepare to stop safely if they can do so before reaching the intersection.

3. **Green Light Phase:** The green light indicates that drivers have the right of way to proceed through the intersection, provided it is clear and safe to do so. Drivers should still exercise caution and be aware of pedestrians and other vehicles.

It is essential to follow the instructions given by traffic signals at all times. Disregarding a red light or failing to yield to the right of way can result in serious consequences and penalties as specified in "Article 9: Prohibited Activities."
