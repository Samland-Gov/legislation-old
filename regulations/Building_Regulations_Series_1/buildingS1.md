## Section A
### Floor Gaps

Floor gaps are a very useful thing which allows you to have wires or cables horrizonally inside your buildings. For verical wiring please see <a href="#conector-tubes">Conector Tubes</a>.

All buildings that want to use electrical, or mechanical, equipment and have more than 2 floors must include a gap of atleast 2 blocks in-between all celings and floors.

As a result, your building will have a space between your floors and celings, this then allows you to run cables horrizonally to equipment e.g. LED Lights.

### Conector Tubes

Conector Tubes allows for verical cable runs inside buildings. These should be used incombination with <a href="#floor-gaps">Floor Gaps</a>.

Conector Tubes are a simple pillar of air which goes through cellings / floors and links up your <a href="#floor-gaps">Floor Gaps</a>. You may surround your Conector Tubes with whatever material you like, as long as it does not obstruct your Conector Tubes.

Don't add too many Conector Tubes because you will loose your floor space!

Ground level Conector Tubes can be brought below ground level and connect with the grid! This can be an advantage as you do not need to provide your own utilities.
